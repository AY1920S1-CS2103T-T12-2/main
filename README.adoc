== About

*DeliveryMANS* is an acronym for Delivery MANagement System. This system is for administrators in food delivery services to manage the restaurants, customers and deliverymen using their food delivery services.

=== All-in-one UI

The UI allows the administrator to have a good overview of all the information needed for tasks to be done efficiently.

=== ChefHat

Administrators are able to set recommendations on the restaurant's menu using the ChefHat system.

=== Deliverymen tracking

Administrators will be able to track the deliverymen on deliveries at a glance. This allows the administrator to manage them better and efficiently queue the orders to each deliverymen.

=== Customer reward tiers

Customers have reward tiers depending on how much they order from the food service. Having higher tiers allows the administrator to assign for food to be delivered to them faster than normal.

=== Customer recommendations

Each food item on each restaurant's menu are tagged with a category. Depending on how many times the customer ordered that item, recommendations will be able to be assigned to the customer

=== CLI based input

The application is a combination of GUI outputs and CLI inputs to allow the administrator to input commands efficiently just using the keyboard.
