== Introduction

*DeliveryMANS* is a command-line application designed specifically for delivery centre administrators who are in charge of food delivery service. It encompasses a well-structured system for users to keep track and manage the entire delivery process. It facilitates food delivery service by coaliasing the delivery men, customers and restaurant menu. From auto-assigning deliverymen for deliveries when orders are made, to viewing statistics of the most popular dish of restaurants as well as customer ordering trends for further promotions, financial and business management decisions, *DeliveryMANS* is everything you need to help improve managing deliveries. With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

**Command Types**

* In *DeliveryMANS*, there are 2 types of commands: universal commands and context-specific commands.
* Universal commands can be called under any context in the application.
* Context-specific commands can only be accessed in a specific context. Context-specific commands comprise customer,
restaurant and deliverymen commands, which can only be called under the customer, restaurant and deliverymen context
respectively.


**Command Format**

* Command words for universal commands are prepended with "-"
** Example Usage: `-help`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `-add_order c/CUSTOMER r/RESTAURANT f/FOOD q/QUANTITY`,
`CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `FOOD` and `QUANTITY` are parameters to be supplied.
** Example Usage: `-add_order c/Donald Trump r/KFC f/Chicken Bucket q/100`

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times e.g. `f/FOOD...` can be used 1 or more:
** Example Usage: `f/3 Piece Chicken Meal` or `f/Pepperoni Pizza f/Char Kway Teow`

* Items with `[]` are optional and can be omitted e.g. `[t/TAG]...`
