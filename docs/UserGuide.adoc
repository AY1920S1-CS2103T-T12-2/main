It encompasses a well-structured system for users to keep track and manage the entire delivery process. It facilitates food delivery service by coaliasing the delivery men, customers and restaurant menu. From auto-assigning deliverymen for deliveries when orders are made, to viewing statistics of the most popular dish of restaurants as well as customer ordering trends for further promotions, financial and business management decisions, *DeliveryMANs* is everything you need to help improve managing deliveries. With just a few simple commands, this delivery manager can help to kickstart your delivery service.

== Features

In *DeliveryMANs*, there are 2 types of commands: universal commands and context-specific commands.

Universal commands can be used anywhere throughout the application. You can identify universal commands by its "-" convention followed by a keyword e.g. `-help`.

Context-specific commands are commands which are only applicable for a specific context. Commands such as viewing a customer ordering history can only be accessed in the customer context.

**Command Format**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add_order c/CUSTOMER r/RESTAURANT f/FOOD q/QUANTITY`, `CUSTOMER`, `RESTAURANT`, `FOOD` and `QUANTITY` are parameters to be replaced.

> `add_order c/Donald Trump r/KFC f/Chicken Bucket q/100`

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times e.g. `f/FOOD...` can be used 1 or more: `f/3 Piece Chicken Meal`, `f/Pepperoni Pizza f/Char Kway Teow` etc.

* Items with `[]` are optional and can be ommitted e.g. `[t/TAG]...`
