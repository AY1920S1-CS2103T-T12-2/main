== PROJECT: DeliveryMANS

---

== Introduction

*DeliveryMANS* is a food delivery management system primarily for administrators in food delivery centres to effectively manage their delivery services. This necessitates
the need to manage 4 different aspects which are food orders, deliverymen, restaurants as well as customers. To accommodate more efficient management of these aspects, *DeliveryMANS* has 4
different in-built interfaces(also known formally as contexts): *universal*/*order*, *deliverymen*, *restaurant*, and *customer*.
The user primarily interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

This is what our project looks like in the case of the deliverymen context:

My role was to design and write the codes for the context for the deliverymen side. This comprises all the features to manage deliverymen status as well as computing crucial
statistics regarding their status.

The following sections illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to
the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
